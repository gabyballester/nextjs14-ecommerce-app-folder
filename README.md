# Project: Next.js Ecomerce Platform (app folder version)

The primary objective of this project is to develop an E-commerce Platform utilizing Next.js 14 and associated technologies. The platform will feature robust authentication mechanisms and an extensive dashboard for efficient management of products and orders. This tech stack ensures the platform can handle complex database operations efficiently while maintaining scalability and robustness.

## Getting Started

1. Run the development server: You can start the development server using one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

2. Editing the Page: You can start editing the main page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

3. Font Optimization: This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font (a custom Google Font).

## Code Quality and Best Practices

The platform ensures high code quality and follows best practices. It’s configured with ESLint, Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, and Husky.

### Base libraries used

- **ESLint**: Maintains code quality and style guidelines.
- **Jest**: Provides testing capabilities for unit and integration tests.
  - **Unit Tests**: Test individual units of code, such as functions or methods.
  - **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between different parts of the application.
- **React Testing Library**: Facilitates maintainable tests for React components, focusing on:
  - **Component Tests**: Test the rendering and behavior of React components.
  - **User Interaction Tests**: Simulate user interactions and test the UI response.
- **Cypress**: Offers end-to-end testing by simulating real user interactions.
- **Husky**: Runs linting and testing scripts before code commit.

## Components and styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS, custom themes, Shadcn components, and react-hot-toast for notifications.

### Lucide-react

A comprehensive icons library for React applications.

### Tailwind CSS and Custom Themes

Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development with utility-first CSS. Custom themes ensure the application has a unique and consistent look and feel.

### Shadcn Components

Shadcn provides a set of customizable, high-quality React components, perfect for building responsive projects. It offers a range of components from basic buttons to complex navigation systems, all designed for customization and ease of use.

#### Data-Table from Shadcn library

The data-table component utilizes Tanstak Table, a highly customizable and performant table library. It is fully compatible with Tailwind CSS, allowing for easy styling and theming to match the rest of the application. This integration ensures the data-table is both flexible and powerful, capable of handling complex data display requirements with ease.

### React-Hot-Toast

React-Hot-Toast is used to display user-friendly notifications and response messages. This library makes it easy to provide real-time feedback to users with elegant and customizable toast messages.

### Cloudinary as File Storage

Utilized for storing and managing images within the app.

## Authentication

The project uses the **Clerk** library, a comprehensive user management and authentication system. Clerk simplifies adding secure sign-in and sign-up functionalities to your application, offering features such as email and password authentication, social logins, multi-factor authentication, and more.

## Libraries for State Management

**Zustand** is used for state management. It is a small, fast, and scalable solution with a comfortable API based on hooks, providing enough convention to be explicit and flux-like without being boilerplate-heavy or opinionated.

## Form Handling

### Elements

**Shadcn** in combination with **React Hook Form** provides performant, flexible, and extensible form handling tools. React Hook Form offers an intuitive API for building forms with minimal re-renders, leveraging existing HTML markup and validating forms using a constraint-based validation API.

### Form validation

**Zod** is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It eliminates duplicative type declarations by allowing developers to declare a validator once, with Zod automatically inferring the corresponding static TypeScript type.

## Database Management

By integrating Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Supabase, the project creates a scalable, secure, and developer-friendly environment. This integration allows focus on building feature-rich applications with Next.js, combining efficient database management, real-time interactions, and modern web development.

### Prisma: Intuitive ORM for Efficient Data Handling

Prisma enhances the Next.js application by streamlining database operations. Its intuitive ORM framework makes data access and manipulation more efficient and type-safe, maintaining the integrity of the application’s data layer.

### PostgreSQL: Robust Database System for Complex Queries

PostgreSQL provides a reliable and powerful database system. It ensures data integrity and supports complex queries, offering the robustness needed for the backend of a full-stack application.

#### DB commands

- Reset and clean up: `npx prisma migrate reset`
- Generate client: `npx prisma generate`
- Sync DB: `npx prisma db push`

### Supabase: Real-Time Serverless DB Platform

Supabase brings real-time capabilities and easy-to-use authentication to the project. It accelerates development with instant APIs and simplifies user management, greatly enhancing the overall user experience.

## To Sum Up

By using this stack, the E-commerce platform will provide a seamless and secure shopping experience for users, ensuring scalability and robustness while efficiently handling complex database operations.
